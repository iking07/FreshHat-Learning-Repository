TITLE: Behind the Pixels

HINT:
Use Openpuff to decode the secret message behind the picture. While doing so, you will need three passwords-which are hidden in the image.
The key to the secret message is hidden in plain sight. Focus carefully on the image to decode the first six letters of the three passwords. Look to the left, then at the top then to the right in order. 
The next two letters are a mystery to solve- a question after a question, surprise after a surprise and finally a question after a surprise.
